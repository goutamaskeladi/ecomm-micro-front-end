Micro-frontend architecture is an architectural style where a front-end application is decomposed into smaller, more manageable pieces (micro-frontends), each developed and deployed independently by different teams. 
Each piece, or micro-frontend, can:
  * Use its own framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
  * Be deployed separately from the rest of the application
  * Communicate with other micro-frontends through well-defined interfaces
